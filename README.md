# What it does
* Forest is the user's credit score. 
* A new sapling is planted each month to represent the start of a new credit cycle 
* With each purchase under the credit limit, we record and track the receipts using Google Vision API to total the monthly statement owed for that card (that tree) 
* At the end of each month, if the credit spends is less than the limit AND gets paid back before the deadline, a new mature tree is added to the forest, increasing credit score/forest health
* If it spending is over the limit or it is not paid in time, the sapling is planted in a chopped/withers state to illustrate the permanent impact on credit score/ forest health.

# Inspiration
The financial literacy gap between youth and adulthood can have a crucial impact on an important transitional time of their lives. One’s financial habits can make or break the individual future plans due to the limitations one’s credit history can have; 
whether it is pursuing post-secondary education or purchase their first home.

In light of the detrimental impact on our environment from humans causing global warming, deforestation and air pollution we plant a new tree for every 100 trees in our user's forest.
